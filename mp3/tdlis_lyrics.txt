[Verse]
Sparks ignite in the factory glow
TDL Energy makes the future flow
Batterypacks hum
The heartbeat of speed
A motorcycle dream
We plant the seed

[Prechorus]
Jack and Jimmy
Hands in the air
Ray and Eza
They're everywhere

[Chorus]
We are future
We are fire
Riding lightning
Climbing higher
Rezy
Etno
Hold the wire
We are future
We inspire

[Verse 2]
Korean minds with precision flair
Building dreams from electric air
Wheels that whisper
Streets that sing
The power we hold
It changes everything

[Prechorus]
Jack and Jimmy
The charge won't fade
Ray and Eza
The path they’ve made

[Chorus]
We are future
We are fire
Riding lightning
Climbing higher
Rezy
Etno
Hold the wire
We are future
We inspire
